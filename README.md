# hello-world
a refresher 
I haven't used Github really since the bootcamp, therefore I figure it is important that I revisit it so I can start using it. Since the bootcamp I have applied to many jobs, though I did find a technical support gig, I need to keep up the good fight! I'm still coding, and losing sleep so I might as well do that during the day too instead of change passwords for middle aged woman.
